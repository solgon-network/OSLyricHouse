I can almost fill the illness<br>
Of the thoughts and words of hate I know your speaking<br> 
Bum bum bum<br>
And I can almost hear the stillness<br> 
Of my heart after years and years of leaking<br>
Bum bum bum<br>
But I fought to long to get here and I always dreaded when this day would come<br>
Hmm hmm hmm<br>
Though your ready for my love<br> 
My love has packed it’s bags and moved along.<br> 

I feel my body tremble<br> 
At the thought of someone else you might be touching<br>
Bum bum bum<br>
And I could tell you I don’t care but we know and it shows that I am bluffing<br> 
Bum bum bum<br> 
And after all the time and shedded tears I always find myself alone<br>
Hmm hmm hmm<br> 
And I thought that Idwait for ever but forever is just a bit to long.<br> 

Now I sit here reminiscing steady thinking<br>
Bout the times where I went wrong <br>
Bum bum bum <br>
You were a mean sonic itch to me<br>
