# Wanna Leave Earth
## Stella Rona

Well I’m packing my bags <br>
And This ain’t the first time<br>
Nothing ever does last<br>
Can’t seem to settle down<br>
Using your words <br>
Like they don’t hurt <br>
I Wanna leave earth <br>

Now I’m calling my kids<br>
Just tryna reach out<br>
Knowing they’ll forget<br>
Cuz I never stayed around<br>
But the further I  go<br>
And the more that I know<br>
Just wanna go home<br>

Unpacking my bags<br>
