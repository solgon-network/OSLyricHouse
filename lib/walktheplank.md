# Walk The Plank
## Theo Gonzales

I waited for you at the dock today<br>
You promised me i won’t forget today<br> 
Yeah I waited for you but you took the other way<br>
Lost and confused<br> 

There you were squirming splashing round<br>
Yelling bloody murder trying not to drown<br>
I seen you struggle not knowing what to do.<br> 
I took a step back and I dove in for you.<br> 

Only just to find, you playing with my mind<br>
I thought I saw the signs, couldn’t read between the lines.<br>
I came to help but you seem fine<br>


Can you love me, from the bottom of the sea<br> 
Can you reach me, as I wish upon a reef<br> 
You can’t save me, I’ve drifted to far away<br>
Jumped in for you, but now I see I walked the plank<br>


I


I’m telling you,
