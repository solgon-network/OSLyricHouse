I tried my best but you couldn’t see<br>
And you tried to but the pain was deep<br>
But life’s goes on after 23<br>
Do you think of him when you look at me<br>

When the tears came streaming down my face<br>
With the years far gone and out of place<br>
I bottom out and leave the state. <br>
When you look back now can you relate<br>

Time is Time <br>
That’s all I know<br> 
A piece of mind is fine until it’s gone <br>
